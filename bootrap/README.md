i am practicing a web application  using  html css and java. it is for food restaurant and i named it " little lemons" 

#BootstrapGrid.html
in  the above mentioned file i have created a logo in center using row and i  have displayed food menu  in columns
 
 it is a good practice for using rows and columns to make your web more structured and by this it will  become accessible.
